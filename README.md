## Overview

Design Deck is an **open-source collection of 230+ system design flash cards**.

It helps you prepare and succeed in your system design interview.

The topics covered are the following:
- [Cache](cache.md): eviction, locations, strategies, when to use a cache, etc.
- [Cloud](cloud.md): main cloud components
- [Database](db.md): ACID, CAP, partitioning, consistency, isolation, denormalization, etc.
- [Design](design.md): general topics such as idempotence, bloom filter, causality, asynchronous communications, vector clocks
- [HTTP](http.md): main HTTP knowledge
- [Kafka](kafka.md): main Kafka building blocks
- [Math](math.md): discrete math
- [Network](network.md): TCP, CORS, ping & heartbeat, OSI, etc.
- [Reliability](reliability.md): reliability patterns
- [Security](security.md): main security knowledge such as TLS, cipher, encryption

## Anki Deck

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a free software (Windows/Mac/Linux/iPhone/Android) which makes remembering things easy. It utilizes spaced repetition which is a proven technique to increase the rate of memorization:

_Spaced Repetition: The most powerful study technique on YouTube_

> The single biggest change that Anki brings about is that it means memory is no longer a haphazard event, to be left to chance. Rather, it guarantees I will remember something, with minimal effort. That is, Anki makes memory a choice.

_Michael A. Nielsen, "Augmenting Long-term Memory"_

Using **Anki is a great way to prepare your system design interview**.
Here is a flashcard example:
